Simulate forest growth

## Setup

Make sure [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) is installed.

run `lein dev` to start a development version in your browser, or see `STRUCTURE.md` for
(a lot) more information.

## Building

To make a production version, run `lein prod`, which will compile and minify everything -
the result can be found in `resources/public/`, which can be served as static files.
An example build can be found [here](https://mruwnik.github.io/forest/).
